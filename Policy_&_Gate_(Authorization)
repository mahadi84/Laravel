Why Policy and Gate?
 How will I restrict Buyer who can only see his transactions/Info.
 How I as Admin see all Buyer(s) transaction(s).


=================Create and Use Policy====================
01.--php artisan make:policy BuyerPolicy --model=Buyer
02.--Check now App\Policies Folder
03.--Create function(s) as per your need for example;
    use App\Models\User;
    use App\Models\Buyer;
     public function view(User $user, Buyer $buyer){
          return $user->id === $buyer->id;
      }
04.--Register policy into AuthServiceProvider.php
   Buyer::class=> BuyerPolicy::class

05.-- Restrict Contoller's function with policy(with middleware)
  public function __construct(){
    $this->middleware('can:view,buyer')->only('index')
  }

=======================Create and Use Gate====================
