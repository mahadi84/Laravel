01. What are NPM, and Composer?
02. Is the same a package.json and a composer.json?







01. What are Composer and NPM?
-------------------------------
doing php/symphony? try composer:----
Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them

doing node? you do npm:-------
npm is the world's largest Software Registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use npm to share software.
So, it's very useful to grab some packages from it.


02. Is the same a package.json and a composer.json?
---------------------------------------------------
They are not the same:
package.json is a npm file to keep track of npm packages.
composer.json is a composer file to keep track of php packages.  the "json" files describe basic package information and dependencies.
